## Introduction

High-accuracy measurements of the rotation angle of the plane of polarization (RAPP)
are needed in many areas of science and engineering [[1]](#1). 
Very few institutes around the world are capable of such measurements.

A new polarimeter will be developed at the Metrology department of ***Instiuto Nacional de TecnologÃ­a Industrial*** ([INTI])
based on the research of ***All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements*** ([VNIIOFI]).

In this setup,
> The problem of measuring the RAPP thus reduces
  to measuring the phase difference of two one-dimensional
  harmonic signals [[1]](#1). 

This repository will be used to host code needed to perform the measurements as well as the code
for the post-processing of the output signals and phase difference computations.
